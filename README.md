# vite-vanilla

Vite with vanilla HTML, CS, and JS

## Getting started

```sh
npm init @vite/latest vite-vanilla
# Choose vanilla and JavaScript
cd vite-vanilla && npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Bundles and starts so fast.
- Hot replacement.
- CSS replaced inline.
- You can use JSX and TS without any modifications.

## Under the covers

Vite uses ESBuild to do all the bundling. ESBuild is built with Go and boosts speeds of 30X webpack.

## Implemented Markdown rendering

Using [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) we can render the GitHub pages.

## Converted to React

Added components for the application
